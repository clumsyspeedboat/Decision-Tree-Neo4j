# Weekly Report - Team Graph Learning - 11/1 to 18/1

## Goals from previous week:
* Update the excel file (base on weekly reports)
* Learn to use Jabref (https://www.jabref.org )
* Read the proposal paper carefully, take notes and prepare questions
* Make a proper tasks division file and weekly expectation for each team member
* Create survey with presentation about:
	* Graph Database 
	* Dataset for machine learning algorithm
	* Decision Tree algorithm in Java
Compare and make tables




## Actual Progress: 
* Implementation of decision trees in Java 
* Create a prototype graph database in neo4j with the dataset
* Implement decision tree in R and create multiple graph for the dataset



## Plans for the upcoming week:
* Implement decision tree in Weka
* Create graph database in neo4j with relationship between nodes
* Check the performance of decision trees in java
