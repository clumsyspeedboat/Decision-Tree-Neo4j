# Weekly Report - Team Graph Learning - 7/12 to 14/12

## Goals from previous week:
* Install Neo4j for everyone. Get to know the basics(select node, connect node, query...)
* Make a report about what we learn with Neo4j (maybe write the report with Latex Overleaf)
* Learn and practice Latex Overleaf to write reports (publish paper IEEE standard)
* https://www.overleaf.com
* Divide the tasks to each team member
* Break down the mile stones 
* Get Data-set from Rahul.


## Actual Progress: 
* Already received the dataset and proposal paper from Rahul
* Install and learn Neo4j (desktop and browser)
* Learn and try to implement Latex Overleaf (We have created a Graph Database in Overleaf)
* Create plans and divide the work to each team member. 


## Plans for the upcoming week:
* Update the excel file (base on weekly reports)
* Learn to use Jabref (https://www.jabref.org )
* Read the proposal paper carefully, take notes and prepare questions
* Make a proper tasks division file and weekly expectation for each team member

* Create survey with presentation about:
  * Graph Database 
  * Dataset for machine learning algorithm
  * Decision Tree algorithm in Java
  * Compare and make tables
